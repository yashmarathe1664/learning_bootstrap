                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>A taxi, also known as a taxicab or simply a cab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride. A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice. 
                        This differs from public transport where the pick-up and drop-off 
                        locations are decided by the service provider, 
                        not by the customers, although demand responsive 
                        transport and share taxis provide a hybrid bus/taxi mode.</p>

                                <p>Due to lockdowns and low demand, COVID-19 had a severe impact on the 
                                   taxi industry as a whole. The shift in consumer preferences towards 
                                   personal vehicles has limited industry growth due to the increased 
                                   risk of congestion in urban areas and social isolation measures</p>
